# pi-network-quantum-resistant-cryptography

A library for quantum-resistant cryptography in the Pi Network, built using NIST PQC candidates and Pi SDK. 

# Pi Network Quantum-Resistant Cryptography

Pi Network Quantum-Resistant Cryptography is a================ cryptographic protocol that uses quantum-resistant algorithms and networks. The protocol ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between parties in a secure manner.

# Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Qiskit 0.33.0 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.4.0 or higher
- NetworkX 2.5 or higher
- Pytest 6.2.3 or higher (for testing)

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/pi-network-quantum-resistant-cryptography.git
```

2. Change the directory to the cloned repository:

```bash

1. cd pi-network-quantum-resistant-cryptography
```
3. Install the required packages:

```bash

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Install the pyqryptos library for quantum-resistant cryptography:
3. pip install pyqryptos
```

# Usage

1. To create a new Pi Network Quantum-Resistant Cryptography instance:

```python

1. from pqcrypto import PIQR
```

# Create a new Pi Network Quantum-Resistant Cryptography instance

```
1. piqr = PIQR()
```
2. To generate a key pair for a party in the network:

```python

1. # Generate a key pair for a party in the network
2. public_key, private_key = piqr.generate_keys()
```

3. To encrypt a message using the public key of a party:

```python

1. # Encrypt a message using the public key of a party
2. encrypted_message = piqr.encrypt(message, public_key)
```

4. To decrypt a message using the private key of a party:

```python

1.# Decrypt a message using the private key of a party
2. decrypted_message = piqr.decrypt(encrypted_message, private_key)
```
5. To perform a key exchange between two parties in the network:

```python

1. # Perform a key exchange between two parties in the network
2. shared_key = piqr.key_exchange(public_key_1, private_key_2)
```

6. To create a new Pi Network Quantum-Resistant Cryptography instance with custom parameters:

```
1. # Create a new Pi Network Quantum-Resistant Cryptography instance with custom parameters
2. piqr_custom = PIQR(custom_parameters)
```
7. To run tests for the Pi Network Quantum-Resistant Cryptography implementation:

```bash

1. pytest tests
```

Please note that the current implementation is for educational purposes and should not be used in production environments. It provides a basic understanding of how quantum-resistant cryptography can be integrated into a network. Further optimizations and enhancements can be made to improve the performance and security of the protocol.

This project has been created for the KOSASIH Challenge, which aims to develop solutions that are compatible with the transition to quantum computing. By incorporating quantum-resistant algorithms and cryptographic techniques into our protocol, we can ensure the continued security and privacy of data exchanged in our Pi Network Quantum-Resistant Cryptography.

Feel free to explore the code, raise issues, and submit pull requests to contribute to the project.
